# Multi-package Releases

If you have a project that consists of multiple related Dart packages then you may want to perform simultaneous releases of all of the related packages.

The Pub Release `multi` command automates simultaneous releases.

{% hint style="info" %}
For simultaneous releases we recommend using github mono repos to ensure a consistent  directory structure as relative paths are used to reference related dependencies.
{% endhint %}
